<h3 class="box"> Welcome to Autumn's Play Date! </h3>
<p> Autumn's Play Date is a place for families to meet other families, plan play dates and stay connected in numerous ways.  My daughter Autumn was the inspiration behind this website. She marched up parents at playgrounds and said "what's your phone number? I want to have a play date with your kid". Most of the time the parents had an awkward response. My first idea was to make a business card with her info on it. Then she could hand it to them and if they call they call. If not no big deal. Then over time I got the idea that there has to be a better way to for parents to connect. We can't be the only family bored and looking for friends for our daughter. So I am super excited to offer Autumn's Playdate to anyone that want's to join what I hope to be a commuity of parents looking for like-minded people to connect to outside outside of Facebook's world of political posts. memes etc...
